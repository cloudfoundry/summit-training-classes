  OK

  pcfdev-org:
                domains:        local.pcfdev.io
                quota:          default (102400M memory limit, unlimited instance memory limit, 1000 routes, -1 services, paid services allowed, unlimited app instance limit, 0 route ports)
                spaces:         pcfdev-space
                space quotas:
  ```


notes: |

  Orgs contain 1 or more spaces.  Organizations are typically used to segregate tenants or projects in a cloud foundry installation.  However, there are no limits and users are free to implement any structure they see fit.
