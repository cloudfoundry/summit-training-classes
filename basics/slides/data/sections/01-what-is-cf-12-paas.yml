  **Application Runtime is PaaS**

  * Cloud Computing taxonomy: **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**
  * PaaS aims to improve developer **productivity**
  * Reduces undifferentiated 'plumbing' aka **'yak shaving'**
  * Heroku blazed a trail for **PaaS** and **12 Factor** apps
  * Applications are the **Cloud Native** unit of currency

notes: |

  IaaS - servers, SaaS - users.

  Heroku created patterns based on their experiences called "12 Factors" that have been heavily influencial. Also drove "buildpack" model
