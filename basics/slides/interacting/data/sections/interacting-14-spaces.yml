  Every *application* and *service* is scoped to a **space**

  ```sh
  $ cf spaces
  ```

  ```sh
  $ cf space <some-space> # for details

  development
      Org:               cf-hero
      Apps:
      Domains:
      Services:
      Security Groups:   public_networks, dns, ssh-logging, p-mysql...
      Space Quota:
  ```

notes: |

  Without a space, an application or service cannot be created.
  A space provides a set of users access to a shared location for application development.
  Each org must contain at least one space.
  If an org contains a single space, that space will be automatically targeted.
