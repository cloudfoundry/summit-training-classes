title: Debugging
---

In this lab, you will use the CF CLI to view an app's logs, as well as to find out what Cloud Foundry itself thinks is happening to your app.

## Push a Buggy App

A buggy app is included in the `06-debugging/debug-app` directory with a manifest.

{{% do %}}Push `06-debugging/debug-app` to Cloud Foundry{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Note the URL{{% /do %}}

### Access the App

{{% do %}}Open a browser and access the app.{{% /do %}}
{{% observe %}}Observe a 500 error.{{% /observe %}}
{{% question %}}What does Cloud Foundry think the health of the app is? How did it draw this conclusion?{{% /question %}}

Getting fast feedback on failures is a key element of agility. The sooner we know something is broken, the sooner we can fix it.

{{% do %}}Use `cf push -\-help` and Cloud Foundry documentation to push the app again, in a way that Cloud Foundry will deem it unhealthy{{% /do %}}

## Check out the Logs

{{% do %}}Use `cf logs` to access the recent logs and debug the issue.{{% /do %}}

If you do not specify the `--recent` flag to `cf logs`, it will start tailing logs from that point onwards.

{{% checking %}}

You should see something similar to this in the logs:

```sh
... [App/0] ERR ...  - RuntimeError - I am a bug, fix me:
```

{{% /checking %}}

### Fix it

This app can be fixed by setting an environment variable and restarting it.

{{% do %}}Use `cf help -a` to find out how to set an environment variable for your app called `FIXED` with a value of `true`{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Restart your app, and visit it in a browser to check that the bug is fixed{{% /do %}}

## Debug with Events

Now the app offers other links that allow you to terminate the app's process, use up all the app's RAM, or fill the disk.

{{% do %}}Click "stop process"{{% /do %}}
{{% observe %}}Observe the output of `cf events` and `cf logs` for your app{{% /observe %}}
{{% do %}}Click "exhaust memory"{{% /do %}}
{{% observe %}}Observe the output of `cf events` and `cf logs` for your app{{% /observe %}}
{{% question %}}How do the two compare? What help does Cloud Foundry give you in determining the cause of failure?{{% /question %}}

{{% checking %}}

You should see something like the following:

```sh
... index: 0, reason: CRASHED, exit_description: 2 error(s) ...
```

{{% /checking %}}

{{% do %}}Click the 'exhaust disk' link, and check `cf logs` and `cf events`.{{% /do %}}
{{% question %}}What happens? Is this what you expected?{{% /question %}}

## Set up App Performance Monitoring

We will demonstrate application performance monitoring using NewRelic.

The **setup process is different for Pivotal Web Services and Swisscom/anynines**. PWS uses Cloud Foundry service brokers to automate some of the manual steps for you.

### PWS Setup

The process involves creating an instance of the New Relic service, binding it to our app, adding a license key, then re-pushing. Services are covered in another section of this course, so don't worry if you don't understand these commands.

{{% do %}}Create a New Relic service instance: `cf create-service newrelic standard newrelic`{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Tell Cloud Foundry that `debug-app` should use your New Relic service instance: `cf bind-service debug-app newrelic`{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Find the New Relic license key in the output of `cf env debug-app`{{% /do %}}

### Swisscom and anynines Setup

Swisscom and anynines do not use the NewRelic Cloud Foundry service broker, so we'll need to set up an account manually.

{{% do %}}Create a new account on [NewRelic.com](https://newrelic.com/signup){{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Click on your account name in the top-right of the welcome dashboard, and **select Account Settings**{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Copy the license key from the right-hand Account Information section{{% /do %}}

### Set the License Key in your App

From now on, the steps are the same regardless of whether you're using PWS, Swisscom or anynines.

{{% do %}}In `newrelic.yml`, replace `YOUR-LICENSE-KEY` with the value you just found{{% /do %}}
{{% do %}}Re-push the app{{% /do %}}

### Viewing the Dashboard

New Relic has a dashboard that you'll already have seen if you signed up for an account manually.

{{% do %}}Visit the NewRelic dashboard, using `cf service newrelic` to find the URL if you're using PWS. {{% /do %}}
{{% do %}} Navigate to the APM section. {{% /do %}}
{{% observe %}} Observe graphs showing app performance data in the New Relic dashboard. Sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes for the data to arrive, and you may need to refresh the page. {{% /observe %}}


## SSH access

Don't forget that you can use `cf ssh` to look at the current filesystem of your app.


## Beyond the Class

* Setup [Skylight](https://www.skylight.io/) for app
* Setup [Opbeat](https://opbeat.com/) for app
* Learn about [CF Logging and Metrics](http://www.cfsummit.com/sites/cfs2015/files/pages/files/cfsummit15_king.pdf)
* Send app logs to [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/)

```sh
$ cf cups logdrain -l syslog://YOUR-PAPERTRAIL-LOG-DESTINATION
$ cf bind-service debug-app logdrain
# Check your Papertrail Events, no need to restart the app
```
