  Who **likes** being paged?

  * Processes are **running software**
  * **Monit** starts and monitors running processes
  * If the process isn't running, **monit restarts it**

notes: |

  Software installed from the release runs in one or more processes on the VM.  Monit is an OSS technology responsible for the running processes.  More "day 2" high availibility.
