  Who **likes** being paged?

  * **Health monitor** pings VMs
  * If the VM doesn't respond **BOSH recreates it**

notes: |

  The health manager in BOSH constantly pings created vms.  When a VM is "gone", BOSH recreates it.  No pages.  No manual intervention necessary.  This is critical to "day 2" operations.
