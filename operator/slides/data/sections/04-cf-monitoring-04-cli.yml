  `cf logs <app name> [--recent]`

  `cf events <app name>`

  `cf app-nozzle` and `cf nozzle`

notes: |

  The Loggregator continuously collects all logs from all apps and CF components. We'll see in a moment how those can be accessed.

  You can stream an app's logs with `cf logs`, or print recent logs with the `--recent` option.

  `cf events` more narrowly shows you a log of [events](https://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.169.0/index.html#audit-events), such as when an app has started or stopped

  `cf app-nozzle` and `cf nozzle` let you access Cloud Foundry's Firehose on the command line. This streams all logs from all apps and components. You need a CLI plugin for these commands.
