## Material Philosophy

* **Presentations** introduce concepts. They should not provide detail and never reformat the same content available on the docs site as bullets.

* **Labs** create experiences.  People learn by doing and labs should be immersive.  They should be guided, but not a cut an paste exercise for the student.

* **Docs** are for detail. Students should get in the habit of reading and referring to the docs sources.
